# time warden

This is a simple telegram api for [timew](https://timewarrior.net).
This <s>app</s> script is not intended to be read or (god forbid) run by anyone but myself. I use github only as handy code and deb storage

# TODO
- [ ] research why binary is so bloated
- [ ] timer asking if we abandon task
- [ ] add good summary command
- [ ] change version in control file (in github action)
- [ ] open keyboard all time?
