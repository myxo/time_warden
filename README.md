# time warden

This is a simple telegram api for [timew](https://timewarrior.net).
This <s>app</s> script is not intended to be read or (god forbid) run by anyone but myself. I use github only as handy code and deb storage

# TODO
- [ ] update package without changing .service file (if no real changes), or systemd thinks it should be reloaded
- [ ] refactor
- [ ] get rid of subcats?
